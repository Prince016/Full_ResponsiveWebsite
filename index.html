            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small ">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small ">
                India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately
                75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate. India's improved education system
                is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress,
                especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public
                institutions. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small ">As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all
                rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to
                report enrollment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this

                Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited
                urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 23 lakh students over
                2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment. While quantitatively India is inching
                closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its

                In January 2019, India had over 900  universities and 40,000 colleges. In India's higher education
                system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the
                historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In
